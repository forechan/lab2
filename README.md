I wasn't able to get a developer account so I used the sample data from class. In this data there are a lot more points on the east coast and there are also some dots in Washington and California. However the most dots appear in New York and Florida. Also there are some places with no dots at all like South Dakota and Wyoming. Virgina, Georgia and Utah also have a lot of dots as well.
